# dagre-d3 - A D3-based renderer for dagre

[Dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to lay out directed graphs on
the client-side. The dagre-d3 library acts as a front-end to dagre, providing
actual rendering using [D3](http://d3js.org).

Because the original libraries are no longer maintained, this is an updated fork of [dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3) that uses the [ciena-dagre](https://github.com/ciena-blueplanet/dagre) and [ciena-graphlib](https://github.com/ciena-blueplanet/ciena-graphlib) forks as dependencies.

The build process now uses webpack, babel and simple npm-scripts instead of gulp. Additionally, the code has been updated to conform with the es6 standard code style.
